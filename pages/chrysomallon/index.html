            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Chrysomallon squamiferum</i> or the scaly-foot snail 
                is a gastropod found at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. 
                What makes it so unique are the overlapping (“imbricating”) 
                scales or <b>sclerites</b> on its foot, which are novel structures 
                evolutionarily unrelated to the gastropod operculum or 
                the superficially similar sclerites of chitons (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12462">Chen et al. 2015</a>). 
                Moreover, the <i>C. squamiferum</i> sclerites are composed of iron sulfides—greigite 
                and pyrite (“fool’s gold”)—which makes the scaly-foot snail the only known 
                animal to carry out biomineralization using sulfur instead of oxygen 
                (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1908533116">Okada et al. 2019</a>). 
                This is one <span class="metal">METAL</span> snail.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scaly foot snail is also notable in that it relies 
                on a symbiotic relationship with bacteria for nutrition. 
                On the ocean bottom, there are only a few sources of energy 
                including scarce amounts of food that sinks from above and 
                hydrothermal vents around the mid-ocean ridges. 
                The scaly-foot snail hosts chemosynthetic bacteria—bacteria capable 
                of deriving energy from the toxic chemical soup from 
                hydrothermal vents to make organic molecules—within 
                the cells lining its esophageal pouch, with modifications 
                to its anatomy to better deliver molecular ingredients 
                to its <b>endosymbionts</b>.

                        This is a scaly-foot snail from the Kairei hydrothermal vent field (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032965">Nakamura et al. 2012</a>) in the Indian Ocean. Though it's only about 4.5 cm (almost 2 inches) in length, it is gigantic for Peltospiridae, the family of deep-sea snails to which it belongs—most Peltospirids reach only about 1–1.5 cm in length. This represents a 10–50 fold increase in body volume (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-017-0917-z">Chen et al. 2017</a>)!

                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the scaly-foot snail is the armor-like sclerites covering its foot. As mentioned, they are composed of iron sulfides, making the scaly-foot snail the only known organism to use sulfur instead of oxygen for biomineralization. The sclerites are constructed by the controlled extrusion of disulfide anions through microscopic channels in the calcium carbonate underlayer of the sclerite—the disulfide anions meet iron cations at the surface of the sclerite, 
                        and form an iron sulfide layer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1908533116">Okada et al. 2019</a>). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is yet unknown whether the iron cations come directly from the diffuse flows around the hydrothermal vent, or if it is biologically mediated. 
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1128%2FAEM.70.5.3082-3090.2004">Goffredi et al. (2004)</a> suggest that, owing to the abundance of delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria on the surface of the sclerites that bacteria mediate the provision of iron cations; 
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1908533116">Okada et al. (2019)</a> instead offer that the disulfide ions directly come in direct contact with iron cations in the diffuse flow.
                    </p>

                <div class="step" data-step="anat_c">
                    <p>
                        The shell of the scaly-foot snail comes in a novel triple-layer structure. It has a rigid aragonite inner layer and a proteinaceous periostracum layer on top like most shelled molluscs, but the periostracum is exceedingly thick and, like the sclerites, covered by an iron sulfide outer layer. This triple-layer construction gives the shell of the scaly-foot snail a unique resilience, with the thick, elastic periostracum layer stopping any stress fractures (e.g. from a crab) on the iron sulfide layer from spreading to the 
                        inner aragonite layer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0912988107">Yao et al. 2010</a>).

                <div class="step" data-step="anat_d">
                    <p>
                        The nervous system of the scaly-foot snail is large but reduced in complexity in comparison to other gastropods in its order (Neomphalida). It has no clear structure, with no brain or ganglia (discrete units of neurons separated by regions without any cells), nor eyes or any other obvious sensory nervous structures on its head—the only notable sensory organ is the pair of statocysts, or balance organs, embedded 
                        in its body (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12983-015-0105-1">Chen et al. 2015</a>). The scaly-foot snail is big, robust, but dumb, kind of like the Hulk!

                <div class="step" data-step="anat_e">
                    <p>
                        The scaly-foot snail has a gill (“ctenidium”) that covers much of the space in its shell, and an enormous heart that would be approximately the size of our heads in human 
                        scale—<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12983-015-0105-1">Chen et al. (2015)</a> likens it to the “heart of a dragon”! Combined with gigantism, an increased circulatory capacity is commonly observed in chemosymbiotic organisms at 
                        hydrothermal vents (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.049023">Childress & Girguis 2011</a>), and is likely an adaptation to keep the endosymbiont bacteria, who ultimately sustain the snail, well-supplied with chemicals from the vent.
