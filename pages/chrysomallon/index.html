                    <p>This is a scaly-foot snail from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032965">Nakamura et al. 2012</a>.
                    Though it's only about 2 inches in length, it's gigantic for snails in its family, Peltospiridae. The increased size 
                    may be an adaptation to increase the amount of symbiotic bacteria it can host.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most distinctive feature of <i>C. squamiferum</i> is the armor-like scales, or <b>sclerites</b>, covering its foot—they 
                    are composed of iron and sulfur, making the scaly-foot snail the only known organism 
                    to use sulfur (instead of oxygen) for biomineralization (Chen et al. 2017).</p>

                    <p>The shell of <i>C. squamiferum</i> is also composed of iron and sulfur, with a core of aragonite within (source).</p>

                    <p>The nervous system of <i>C. squamiferum</i> is small, suggesting that it does not need high intelligence to survive.</p>

                    <p>However, <i>C. squamiferum</i> has a very large gill (ctenidium) and heart to supply nutrients to the symbiotic bacteria living in its esophageal gland.</p>

These ridges are dotted along their lengths with active hydrothermal vents.

                    <p>We, above the surface, eat plants or eat organisms that have eaten plants. Plants are an example of photoautotrophs.

                        but it is not enough for C. squamiferum. Instead, C. squamiferum uses gamma-proteobacteria that can harness
                        the chemical energy of deep sea hydrothermal vents to fix inorganic carbon into organic matter.</p></div>

            <p>This page was made with Scrollama and Leaflet packages. I relied on these excellent tutorial videos [1] [2] for Scrollama and these posts [1] [2] for Leaflet.</p>
