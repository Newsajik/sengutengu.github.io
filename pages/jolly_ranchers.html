            (June 3, 2024) Yesterday, I happened across this reddit post that showed a <i>very</i> uneven distribution of Jolly Rancher flavors in two bags:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1d6lxdd/uneven_distribution_of_jolly_ranchers_in_2_400g/">Uneven distribution of Jolly Ranchers in 2 400g (7oz) bags.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cancel_me_now/">u/Cancel_me_now</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/">mildlyinteresting</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
        <p>
            I was wondering if a fair sorting machine could feasibly produce this kind of distribution. 
            Another way of posing this question would be: does Hershey try to put equal amounts of all flavors into a bag?
            In this situation, the null hypothesis would be that the observed distribution came from a fair sorting machine, 
            and the alternate hypothesis that the observed distribution did not come from a fair sorting machine.
            I decided to run a chi-square goodness of fit test to find out. 
        </p>
        <p>
            First, I counted all the flavors and added them up:
        </p>
        <PRE>
    grape <- 4
    cherry <- 8
    apple <- 12
    watermelon <- 24
    raspberry <- 20
    count <- c(grape, cherry, apple, watermelon, raspberry)
    count
    ----------
    >>> 68
        </PRE>
        
        <p>
            It turns out that in two bags, there were 68 Jolly Ranchers. 
            Dividing this figure by the number of flavors, we can get the expected value (13.6) of each flavor if the machine sorting was truly fair.
        </p>
        <PRE>
    expected_value <- sum(count)/5
    expected_value
    ----------
    >>> 13.6
        </PRE>
        <p>
            Then, I calculated the chi-square statistic (20.235) and the degrees of freedom (4) following the chi-square formula:
            <math display="block" class="tml-display" style="display:block math;">
                <mrow>
                  <msup>
                    <mi>χ</mi>
                    <mn>2</mn>
                  </msup>
                  <mo>=</mo>
                  <mo movablelimits="false">∑</mo>
                  <mfrac>
                    <mrow>
                      <mo form="prefix" stretchy="false" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">(</mo>
                      <mtext>observed</mtext>
                      <mo>−</mo>
                      <mtext>expected</mtext>
                      <msup>
                        <mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo>
                        <mn>2</mn>
                      </msup>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>expected</mtext>
                  </mfrac>
                </mrow>
              </math>
        </p>
        <PRE>
    Xsq <- sum(((count-expected_value)^2)/expected_value)
    df <- length(count)-1
    Xsq
    df
    ----------
    >>> 20.23529
    >>> 4
        </PRE>
        <p>
            Finally, I used the <code>pchisq()</code> function to calculate the p-value (p=0.000449).
        </p>
        <PRE>
    pchisq(Xsq, df, lower.tail=F)
    ----------
    0.0004487191
        </PRE>
        <p>
            It turns out that a totally fair Jolly Rancher sorting machine would have a 0.0449% chance of producing the mix of Jolly Ranchers in these two bags.
            This is exceedingly unlikely, and we can safely rule out the null hypothesis that these Jolly Ranchers came from a fair sorting machine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the grape flavor is generally regarded as the worst flavor, I think Hershey may have decided to decrease 
            the number of grape Jolly Ranchers in each bag, and reward the popular opinion that watermelon and blue raspberry 
            are the best. I reached out to Hershey to ask about the actual ratio that they shoot for but I haven't heard back yet.
